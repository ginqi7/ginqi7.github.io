    <p>
When we first parted, we each entered different worlds, some fresh and exciting, others daunting and frightening. We often talked about our experiences, sometimes with excitement, sometimes with sadness. We felt that at this moment, we had someone to confide in, to share our joys and sorrows with. It felt warm and beautiful, and our relationship felt deeper than ever before.
</p>

<p>
As time went on, we got used to our new worlds and became busy with our own lives. We still kept in touch with each other, but we soon realized that sometimes we couldn't help each other with our problems or understand each other's joy.
</p>

<p>
When we finally reunited after a long time, we had so much to say, but didn't know where to start, so we just chatted about the weather and other small things. Before we knew it, we had run out of things to say. Maybe we weren't old enough to reminisce endlessly about the past, or maybe we had completely different perspectives on new things. We didn't burst each other's bubbles, we just continued with small talk. Occasionally, we shared our thoughts, but found it difficult to agree with each other, so we either nodded and said "I agree," or just smiled and changed the subject. If someone else were to observe our conversation, they would see two people laughing and agreeing with each other, seemingly in harmony.
</p>

<p>
As we parted ways again, "we exchanged pleasantries and promises to meet again", and each breathed a sigh of relief as the other left.
</p>

<p>
On the way home, thinking back to our meeting, tears welled up in our eyes.
