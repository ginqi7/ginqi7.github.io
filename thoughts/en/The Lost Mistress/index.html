   <b>
    The Lost Mistress by Robert Browning
   </b>
  </div>

   "
  </div>
  <div>
   All’s over, then: does truth sound bitter
  </div>
  <div>
   As one at first believes?
  </div>
  <div>
   Hark, ’tis the sparrows’ good-night twitter
  </div>
  <div>
   About your cottage eaves!
  </div>
  <div>
   And the leaf-buds on the vine are woolly,
  </div>
  <div>
   I noticed that, today;
  </div>
  <div>
   One day more bursts them open fully
  </div>
  <div>
   – You know the red turns grey.
  </div>
  <div>
   Tomorrow we meet the same then, dearest?
  </div>
  <div>
   May I take your hand in mine?
  </div>
  <div>
   Mere friends are we, – well, friends the merest
  </div>
  <div>
   Keep much that I resign:
  </div>
  <div>
   For each glance of the eye so bright and black,
  </div>
  <div>
   Though I keep with heart’s endeavor, –
  </div>
  <div>
   Your voice, when you wish the snowdrops back,
  </div>
  <div>
   Though it stay in my soul for ever! –
  </div>
  <div>
   Yet I will but say what mere friends say,
  </div>
  <div>
   Or only a thought stronger;
  </div>
  <div>
   I will hold your hand but as long as all may,
  </div>
  <div>
   Or so very little longer!
